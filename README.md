<!-- h1 align='center'> hello world! :wave:</h1-->
<p align='center'>
  I have been testing software for half of my life. one of the best things I've learned is that <b>quality</b> lords over quantity.<br>  
  I don't just test and automate! I look at the overall <b>quality</b> of the product and engineering experience :heart:.
</p>
<p align='center'>I mainly use Javascript & Node nowadays and Typescript to some degree, and have used (but am now rusty) Python, Java, and Dotnet.</p>

- 🤖 I've built e2e, api, ui test automation frameworks using Playwright, Cypress, and in my previous life, Selenium.
- 📱 I've designed mobile app frameworks for both iOS and Android using Maestro, Appium and Detox. 
- 💪 I've created performance test automation tools using k6 and Artillery and embedded security checks using Snyk and Stackhawk.
- 🕸️ I've embedded these tools into fully DevOps capabilities using CI/CD tools such as Gitlab, Buildkite, and Bitbucket Pipelines.
- 🔭 I've integrated Observability tools using Sumologic, Cloudwatch, Datadog, and NewRelic.
- 📝 I've scripted using shell/bash scripts and YAML files to automate processes and have done some Machine Learning (ML) modelling using Jupyter and OpenAI.
- 🌩️ I've performed tasks using Cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Databases using Postgres, MySQL, and MongoDB.
- 💬 Ask me about NBA and Quality engineering
- 👨‍💻 I’m looking to collaborate on https://dev.to/poponuts

### Sample works (most of the extensive test automation frameworks I have done are set to private!) 😉
